# Soc Interview Questions and Answers - CYBER SECURITY ANALYST

# 1. What do you know about the company?

The “company” is one of the global telecommunications technology leaders that deliver innovative IT solutions and offers wireless products and services including cybersecurity operations centers. “The company” is an American company founded in 2000 and headquartered in New York. “The company” has over 135K employees in 150 global locations. “The company” has opened 10th security operation center in Canberra providing SOC services to both public and private sector.

# 2. What is cybersecurity and why do companies need it?

Cybersecurity is the combination and implementation of security software, hardware, policies, and procedures in computer, network, and information technology systems to protect devices, sensitive data, and services from unauthorized access and modification. Companies need very well-equipped and operated cybersecurity strategies to prevent any damage from occurring to their valuable assets and business.

# 3. What do you have in your home network?

I set up a very strong user name and password for my router and Wi-Fi, its broadcasting feature is
disabled. I set up MAC address filtering on the router and I use WPA2 (Wi-Fi protected access 2) security encryption technology. It encrypts the traffic on wi-fi networks. I disabled the remote access feature. I use a firewall and configure its security measures and it is always on.

# 4. What is the CIA triad? (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

**CIA** is an abbreviation of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. In cybersecurity, these three are the core elements of information security that are kept in place and protected from adverse impacts of incidents such as unauthorized access, disruption, misuse, disclosure, corruption, deletion, modification, etc.

**Confidentiality** is the term used to describe information/data privacy which means the information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized entities or individuals.


**Integrity** is the term used to describe information/data accuracy and completeness throughout its lifecycle. That means that the data cannot be modified by unauthorized entities or individuals.


**Availability** is the term used to describe information/data being available when needed. Availability systems need to remain available at all times preventing service disruptions due to power outages, hardware failures or system upgrades.




# 5. Explain the difference between process, guidelines, and policies?

These are the most popular Cyber Security Interview Questions asked in an interview. A process can be defined in this way; it is step-by-step information that helps in specifying what would be the next action and an implementation part. Guidelines are referred to as the recommendation is given to the applications or network, which can be customized and these can be used while creating any procedures. Policies are defined as the criteria for security objectives and the organization’s security framework.

# 6. What is the meaning of AAA?

AAA stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting.

**Authentication** is the process of determining if a user is legitimate to use the system and the network. Authentication is usually done using login and password. For example, you will use a username and password to access your email. The email server authenticates your username and password and provides further access.

**Authorization** refers to access control rights. This implies every user on the network is allowed access to certain portions of data and information and applications according to his/her level in the organization. **For example**, a marketing person will not be able to record financial transactions. Hence, a user is authorized to perform only certain functions on the network system. These
authorization levels are defined by the system administrator who has access to all the resources and
user policies in the network.

**Accounting** is known as network accounting which is used to gather all activity on the network for
each use.

Hence, AAA is a framework for network security that is used to control user access, implement
policies, audit usage and keep track of all activities in the network. AAA helps the system
administrators and security experts to identify any malicious activity on the network.

# 7. What is Risk, Threat and Vulnerability in a network?

**Risk** is any potential loss of, damage, or destruction of an asset as a result of a threat exploiting a vulnerability. Risk is the intersection of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities.

**Threat:** Anything that can exploit a vulnerability, intentionally or unintentionally, to obtain, damage, or destroying an asset.

**Vulnerability:** Weaknesses or gaps in a network, software or system that can be exploited by any threats to gain unauthorized access to an asset.


# 8. What are IDS and IPS and How do you differentiate between IDS and IPS system?

**IDS** is an Intrusion Detection System that analyses network traffic for signatures of incidents/events that match known cyberattacks.

**IPS** is Intrusion Prevention System also analyses packets, but can also stop the packet from being delivered.

They are both parts of the network infrastructure. They both compare network packets to cyberthreat databases containing known signatures of cyberattacks and flag any matching packets.

The main difference between them is that IDS is a monitoring system, while IPS is a control system. IDS does not alter the network packets in any way whereas IPS prevents the packet from delivery based on the contents much like how a firewall prevents traffic by IP address. IDS requires a human or another system to look at the results.

Many IDS/IPS systems are integrated with firewalls to create unified threat management technology.IDS and IPS are located in the same area where the firewall is located between the outside world and the internal network.IDS/IPS system covers Automation, compliance, and policy enforcement.


A traditional firewall implements rules that prevent network traffic based on protocol, source/destination address, and/or source/destination port. Firewalls can help you implement access control lists and prevent the use of insecure protocols.IPS works by analyzing the headers and payloads of packets and if suspicious behavior is detected, it can drop the packets. In short, by analyzing the entirety of network packets, IPS can detect potentially malicious behavior that does not inherently violate firewall rules. There are host-based IDS and IPS and also Network-based IPS/IDS anomaly-based detection first creates a baseline of network activity and then compares traffic to that baseline. If network traffic deviates significantly from the baseline, it can be interpreted as a threat.

Security information and event management, SIEMs help make IPS and IDS more scalable and can better enable organizations to achieve compliance, improve reporting, and identify correlations that can indicate a broader threat. In short, SIEMs enable organizations to scale their IDS and IPS data into a more complete security solution.

# 9. What do you know about cybersecurity frameworks?

An information security framework is a series of documented, agreed, and understood policies, procedures, and processes that define how information is managed in a business to lower risk and vulnerability and increase confidence.

**Some of the most common frameworks are:**

- International Standards Organisation (ISO) 27K

- Australian Signal Directorate (ASD) Essential 8 -> ASD agency is responsible for cyber welfare
and information security. The ASD’s cyber division is known as the Australian Cyber Security
Centre (ACSC). The ACSC provides information, advice, and assistance to prevent and
combat cybersecurity threats in public and private sectors.

- US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-> US agency for industry standardisation and measurements.

- Industry-Specific Standards

- CIS (Critical Security Controls)


# 10. What is a SIEM?

SIEM is Security Information and Event Management software that provides a holistic view of what is happening on a network in real-time and help cybersecurity analyst to be more proactive in the fight against security threats.

SEM security event management carries out analysis of the event and logs data in real-time to provide event correlation, threat monitoring, and incident response

SIM security information management retrieves and analyses log data and generate a report. For the organization that wants complete visibility and control over what is happening on their network in real-time, SIEM solutions are critical.

**How Does SIEM work?**

SIEM collects log and event data that is generated by host systems, security devices, and applications throughout an organization’s network infrastructure and collating it on a centralized platform. From antivirus events to firewall logs, SIEM software identifies this data and sorts it into categories, such as malware activity, failed and successful logins, and other potentially malicious activity.

When software identifies activity that could signify a threat, alerts are generated to indicate a potential security issue. These alerts can be set either low or high priority using pre-defined rules.

SIEM solutions provide a powerful method of threat detection, real-time reporting, and monitoring, long term analytics of security logs and events.

A single alert from an antivirus filter may not be a cause of panic on its own, but if traffic anomaly alerts are received from the firewall at the same time, this could signify that a severe breach is in progress. SIEM collects all of these alerts in a centralized console, allowing fast and thorough analysis.

# 11. What is weak information security policy?

An information security policy must be strong in terms of distribution, review, comprehension, compliance, and uniformity. Information security considered weak if:

- The policy has not made readily available for review by all employees.

- An organisation is unable to prove that employees reviewed and understood the content of the policy.

# 12. How can identity theft be prevented?

- Ensure strong password

- Avoid sharing confidential information online on social media

- Shop from known and trusted websites

- Use the latest version of browsers

- Install advanced malware and spyware protection tools

- Update your system and software

# 13. How can you prevent Man-in-the-middle-attack?

MITM attack happens when a communication between two parties is intruded or intercepted by an outside entity.

- Use encryption (public-key encryption) between both parties
- Avoid using open wi-fi networks.
- Use HTTPS, forced TLS or VPN.

# 14. What is a DDOS attack and how is it mitigated?

DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) is when a network is flooded with a large number of requests which is not recognized to handle and making the server unavailable to the legitimate requests.

DDOS can be mitigated by analyzing and filtering the traffic in the scrubbing centers. The scrubbing centers are centralized data cleansing stations wherein the traffic to a website is analyzed and the malicious traffic is removed.

# 15. What is a brute-force attack and how is it mitigated?

In a brute force attack, the attacker tries to determine the password for a target through permutation or fuzzing process. As it is a lengthy task, attackers usually employ software such as fuzzer or hydra, to automate the process of creating numerous passwords to be tested against a target.

In order to avoid such attacks-password best practices should be followed, mainly on critical
resources like servers, routers.

# 16. Why do you need DNS (Domain Name System) monitoring?

When you add your domain(s) to a DNS provider’s name servers, you are making those name servers authoritative for answering your domain’s incoming queries. DNS is the first point of contact between you and your clients, so it is crucial to keep an eye on the service you trust to manage it.

DNS monitoring uses network monitoring tools to test connectivity between your authoritative name servers and local recursive servers. The queries have to ask multiple servers for the DNS information until they finally reach the name server authoritative for the domain. We can also monitor the connection between actual clients and the authoritative name servers.

What you can control is actually the most important part of the DNS process, the performance of your authoritative name server answering the recursive name server on the return trip.

Sonar offers an automated monitoring service that checks your domain as often as every 30 seconds for performance changes. You can also set up instant alerts to email or text you when there are any
significant deviations.

Inspecting DNS traffic between the client’s devices and your local recursive resolver could be revealing a wealth of information for forensic analysis. DNS queries can reveal bot botnets and malware is connecting to the C&C server, so this is why DNS monitoring is very essential.

# 17. What are encoding, hashing and encryption?

**Encoding:** Converts the data in the desired format required for exchange between different systems.

**Hashing:** Maintains the integrity of a message or data. Any change did any day could be noticed.

**Encryption:** Ensures that the data is secure and one needs a digital verification code or image in order to open it or access it.

# 18. What steps will you take to secure a server?

Secure servers use the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol for data encryption and decryption to protect data.

- Have a secure password for the root and administrator users.
- Make new users that you use to manage the system.
- Remove remote access from default.
- Configure firewall rules for remote access.


# 19. What is black hat, white hat and grey hat hackers?

**Black hat hackers:** are those who hack without authority

**White hat hackers:** are authorized to perform a hacking attempt under signed NDA (non-disclosure agreement)

**Grey hat hackers:** are white hat hackers who sometimes perform unauthorized activities.

# 20. What do you know about application security?

It is the practice of improving the security of applications using software, hardware, and other procedural methods.

Countermeasures are taken to ensure application security, the most common one is an application firewall that limits the execution of files or the handling of data by specific installed programs.

# 21. Can you tell me about common cyber-attacks?

**Malware:** Malicious software that infects your computer, such as computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, and adware.

**DDOS:** A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack — or DDoS attack — is when a malicious
the user gets a network of zombie computers to sabotage a specific website or server.

**Hacking:** Hacking is a term used to describe actions taken by someone to gain unauthorized
access to a computer.

**Phishing:** Fake emails, text messages, and websites created to look like they’re from authentic companies. They’re sent by criminals to steal personal and financial information from you. This is also known as “spoofing”.

# 22. What are the OSI layers and what is the job of network layer?

It is Open System Interconnection is a reference model for how applications communicate over a network. There 7 layers in OSI which are:

- **Application layer** ->Data -> network process and apps -> SMTP, telnet, HTTP, FTP, etc.
- **Presentation Layer** ->Data -> Data formatting and encryption -> JPG, HTTPS, SSL
- **Session layer** ->Data -> establishes/ends connections between two hosts -> NetBIOS, PPTP
- **Transport layer** ->Segments -> end-to-end connections and reliability -> TCP, UDP
- **Network layer** -> Packets -> Path determination and IP (logical addressing) -> routers and layer3 switches
- **Data link layer** -> Frames -> Physical addressing – > switches
- **Physical layer** -> Bits -> Send data on to the physical wire -> Hubs, NICS, cables

# 23. How would you reset a password-protected BIOS configuration?

Pop-out the CMOS or set the factory by using the default password.

# 24. What is 2FA and how can it be implemented for the public websites?

2FA (two-factor authentication) is an extra layer of security that requires not the only username and password but also something that only the user knows or have (knowledge, possession, inherence)

Authenticator apps replace the need to obtain a verification code via text, voice call or email.

# 25. What are the three main transmission modes between devices in computer network?

**Simplex mode:** data can be sent only in one direction i.e. communication is unidirectional. We cannot send a message back to the sender.

**Half-duplex mode:** data can be transmitted in both directions on a signal carrier, but not at the same time.

**Full duplex mode:** we can send data in both directions as it is bidirectional at the same time, in other words, data can be sent in both directions simultaneously.

# 26. What are the network types?

LAN, WAN, personal area, WLAN, Metropolitan, Storage area network, System area network.

# 27. What is data centre multi-tier model design?

This design consists primarily of the web, application, and database server tiers running on various platforms including blade servers, one rack unit (1RU) servers, and mainframes. Core, aggregation, and access.

# 28. What are TCP header flags and what they do?

**Source port:** Sending port (16 bits)

**Destination Port (16 bits):** receiving port

**Flags:**

- SYN
- URG
- ACK
- PSH
- RST
- FIN

# 29. What is SSDP?

**Simple service discovery protocol:** The Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) is a network protocol based on the Internet protocol suite for the advertisement and discovery of network services and presence information.

A Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) attack is a reflection-based distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) the attack that exploits Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) networking protocols in order to send an amplified amount of traffic to a targeted victim, overwhelming the target’s infrastructure and taking their web resource offline.

Source port, destination port, length, checksum, data.

# 30. What are intrusion detection methods? Explain them

The intrusion detection system is a device or software that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity any violation is reported to the SIEM system. IDS types can be host-based and network-based. IDS can detect a malicious activity based on a signature-based approach or anomaly-based approach or a combination of both.

# 31. What is SNMP?

SNMP (Simple network management protocol) is an internet standard protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on IP networks and for modifying that information to change device behavior. It is an application layer protocol

# 32. What are sniffing attacks? Explain them

A sniffer attack corresponds to theft or interception of data by capturing the network traffic using a sniffer. When data is transmitted across the network, if the data is not encrypted the data within the network packet can be read using a sniffer such as Wireshark.

# 33. What is MAC spoofing? Explain

MAC address is virtually etched to the hardware by the manufacturer. Users are not able to change or rewrite the MAC address but it is possible to mask it on the software side. This masking is what is referred to as MAC spoofing.

Hackers use this method of attack to conceal their own identity and imitate another.

# 34. What is ARP and ARP poisoning (Flooding)?

ARP (Address resolution protocol) is a protocol for mapping an IP address to a physical machine address (MAC address) that is recognized in the local network.

When an incoming packet destined for a host machine on a particular local area network arrives ar a gateway, the gateway asks ARP program to find a physical host or MAC address that matches the IP address.

The ARP program looks in the ARP cache and If it finds the address in the ARP cache it provides the MAC address so that the packet can be converted to the right packet length and format and sent to the destination machine. If no IP address is found, ARP broadcasts the request in a special format to all the machines on the LAN to see if one machine knows that IP address associated with it.

ARP poisoning is ARP spoofing, ARP cache poisoning, or ARP poison routing, is a technique by which an attacker sends (spoofed) Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages onto a local area network. Generally, the aim is to associate the attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of another host, such as the default gateway, causing any traffic meant for that IP address to be sent to the attacker instead.

ARP spoofing may allow an attacker to intercept data frames on a network, modify the traffic, or stop all traffic. Often the attack is used as an opening for other attacks, such as denial of service, man in the middle, or session hijacking attacks.


# 35. What are three main data transmission methods in layer 2?

Unicast, Broadcast, Multicast (Explain each one)

# 36. What is DHCP?

DHCP is a dynamic host configuration protocol. When it is activated, DHCP assigns IP addresses to devices on the network.

# 37. What is VLAN? What is the difference between VPN and VLAN?

**VPN:** it is related to remote access to a network with a secured and encrypted tunnel. Saves the data from prying eye while in transit and no one on the net can capture the packets.

**VLAN:** Helps to group work stations that are not within the same locations into the same broadcast domain. Logically segregates networks without physical segregation with switches. Does not involve any encryption.

# 38. What is port blocking within LAN?

Restricting users from accessing a set of services within the local area network is called port blocking.

Stopping the source not to access the destination node via port as the application works on the ports are blocked to restrict access.

# 39. What tools are commonly used to secure a standard network?

Firewalls, end-point antiviruses, security policies and procedures, IDS/IPS, password managers.
